This code is very custom. If you might wanna use it feel free to text me on discord (KaiserLudwigIV #9531) and ill give you a quick introduction or I will add it here later. The code is written for a esp8266 to drive a webserver and socket with data from a sd card to control a ledstrip (ws2812b).

In order to compile and make it work, please change/replace the dist.cpp, dist.h and every link to dist with the folders name. Might change it later myself tho...
